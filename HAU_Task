Activity Title:

Timeline of Operating Systems Development

Objective:
To create a detailed, collaborative timeline that covers the entire history of Operating Systems (OS) from the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, to the present. Groups will research, design, and submit the timeline, and then engage in a Q&A session to measure understanding of OS evolution.

Instructions:

Work with your group members. 
Each team will create one comprehensive timeline that covers key milestones in OS development from the 1950s to the present.
Divide the work among group members so each person focuses on a specific time period. Then, combine your individual research into one cohesive timeline.
Use a digital file format (e.g., Word) and include the following for each time period:
Key operating systems released during that time.
Important people and organizations involved in OS development.
Notable innovations (e.g., multitasking, graphical user interfaces, networking, security, etc.).
Historical context (e.g., rise of personal computers, networking, mobile computing).
Any other significant milestones.
  You may use credible sources (books, academic articles, educational websites).

  5. Include a brief section or page in your final submission listing each team member’s specific contributions to the project.

  6. Attach the grading rubric with your report.

  7. Print your file on short bond paper for submission during next week’s face-to-face class.

  8. Be prepared to participate in a group quiz following the submission. A set of questions will be provided to each group.
